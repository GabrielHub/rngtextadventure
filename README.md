# Misdirection - An Experimental Text Adventure!

#### A text adventure game with a random story every time! - By Gabriel Ong and Sawyer Smith

## About:
Misdirection is a randomly generated series of stories taking place in a purgatory-like dungeon. Each play-through is unique, as every module between the beginning and end is shuffled each time the game is loaded.

## How it works:

The first story module is always the same. From there, players will have to make one of two choices, from randomly chosen events. Players can find weapons, discover more about their past, and fight monsters.
